    <h2>Predictive Analysis of Energy Consumption and Electricity Demand Using Machine Learning Techniques</h2>
    <h3><b>Issuer:</b> Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE)</h3>
    <p>XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM were used to forecast electricity demand based on 15 years of hourly data. Features like hour, day, and month were combined with time series techniques such as wavelet transforms and autocorrelation plots. Evaluation was done using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.</p>

<p>LightGBM performed best with an R-squared of <strong>0.946</strong>, RMSE of <strong>560.08</strong>, and MAE of <strong>426.17</strong>. CatBoost followed with <strong>0.872</strong> R-squared, and XGBoost had the lowest at <strong>0.775</strong>. These results confirm LightGBMâ€™s accuracy and efficiency in energy demand forecasting.</p>
